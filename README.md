# godot-prototype-1
First out of (potentially) several really small Godot prototypes to try out game development.

The only purpose here is to have several sessions figuring out what I want to build.

The end condition for the prototype is: figure out whether I want to continue 100% fully focusing on this game idea or I want to move on and try something else (and potentially build another prototype). This is supposed to have 3 short (around 2 hour long) work sessions per week, and maybe 2-3 weeks of work overall, not much more than that. By the end of the prototype, the "spike"/research results will be logged in a private Trello board, and this repository will (probably) be archived or just marked as "FINISHED" in Readme.
